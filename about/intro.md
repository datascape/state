Based on your selected indicators and industries, 
we'll form <b>DBSCAN</b> clusters of zip codes which you can apply   
to find opportunities and filter locations. 

Our focus area filters are seeded with <b>Random Forest</b> importance indicators using job and income levels, employment levels across multiple industries, work experience, education level, crime stats, <span style="white-space:nowrap;">and poverty</span> levels for adults, children <span style="white-space:nowrap;">and seniors</span>.<br><br>

<div class="hidetextX">
Our community forecasting model is trained using time series Census and FBI data from 2012 to 2016. Each indicator's performance is compared to prior <!-- two-->years to generate projected estimates for the next 5 years. Projections are
<span style="white-space:nowrap">based</span> on a cross validated <span style="white-space:nowrap"><b>Lasso Regression</b></span> Least Angle Regression (LARS) forward-selection algorithm.
