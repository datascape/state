[USEEIO Extended Input-Output Model](https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_report.cfm?Lab=NRMRL&dirEntryId=336332)


<!--### Topic Themes-->

The EPA's Sustainable Materials Management (SMM) USEEIO model covers potential impacts to human health, air, water and soil from all goods and services consumed in the US in approximately 400 categories, including:


Carcinogen Free Products<!--(toxin free manufacturing)-->  
Clean Energy<!-- (solar, geothermal, hydrogen, 4th-generation nuclear)-->  
Clean Water  
Recycled/Reclaimed Products  

<!--
Handsfree Devices (AR headsets, heads-up computing, hands-free devices)  
Living Buildings  (living building challenge, 7 petals: energy, equity, health, beauty, materials, site, water)  
Local Sourcing  (locally made, reduced shipping, package-free, local carts)    
Metal-Organic Frameworks (mof, harvesting water from air)  
Nano Wood and Super Wood  
Reclaiming Carbon  
Reduced Packaging  
Restoring Waterways  (clean water, swimming, rivers, lakes, public, parks)  
Recycling Plastics (recycling centers, conversion to [naphtha](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/02/190206131956.htm))  
Shared Mobility (shared mobility API, electric bikes, electric scooters)   
Upwardly Mobility  (workforce, gig economy, mentor networks)
